# CLI Contacts Simulator

CCS is a very simple cli program I made to learn kotlin, it basically simulates a contacts and messages app with saving
to json, you can add contacts and "send messages" and other cool stuff.

it uses gson for json handling and that's really the only dependency.

run it with -h or --help for help.
